[DoubleDutch](https://doubledutch.me) apps are extensible, offering developers the ability to provide attendees
with rich custom native experiences with minimal development effort.

Build extensions in hours, not weeks.

- Build cross-platform extensions quickly with [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/).
- Deploy them with our developer tools
- Use the DoubleDutch CMS to embed extensions in your DoubleDutch event app.

Need a backend for persisting and retrieving data securely?  Don't worry about deploying servers. Connect your extension to [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) from [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) in minutes. Use our preconfigured project, or create your own.
